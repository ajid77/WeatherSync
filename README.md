SSteps to Deploy

    Compile the Script:
        Open a new C# project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
        Add references to the necessary Script Hook V .NET libraries (ScriptHookVDotNet.dll, ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll, etc.).
        Add the WeatherSync.cs script to your project.
        Compile the project to produce a .dll file.

    Place the Files:
        Copy the compiled .dll file (e.g., WeatherSync.dll) to the scripts folder in your GTA V directory.
        Place the WeatherSync.ini file in the same scripts folder.

    Run the Game:
        Start GTA V.
        The script should run and update the weather in-game to match the real-world weather of the specified location every minute.

By following these instructions, you'll have a working GTA V mod script that syncs the in-game weather with your real-world location using data from an .ini file for configuration.
